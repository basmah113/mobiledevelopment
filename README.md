**MobileDevelopment**

**Overview**

This project contains Mobile Game Development project developed using Unity, Unreal Engine and Visual Studio. It will be thoroughly tested using an Android Samsung A52 device with API 31. Lightdash:Break the Beam is a single-player mobile game that combines fast-paced reflexes with strategic puzzle-solving. The player is trapped in a series of increasingly complex laser filled rooms and must navigate through the maze while avoiding deadly lasers and other obstacles. The game includes four progressively challenging levels, each with unique environments and mechanics to test the player's skill.
The game is built using Unity and C# for scripting. The project focuses on implementing dynamic obstacles, responsive controls, and level progression to keep players engaged on Mobile App.

**Description of the Game**

In Lightdash:Break the Beam, player is tasked with escaping from a series of laser filled rooms. Each level presents a different challenge, ranging from dodging moving laser beams, solving mazes, to performing precision jumps in parkour-style sections. The goal is to reach the exit, all while avoiding deadly laser beams. 

**Levels:**

- Level 1 – Laser Room:
Player is introduced to the basic mechanics by navigating through a room filled with stationary lasers. The objective is simple: avoid touching the lasers and reach the exit.

- Level 2 – Maze Challenge:
This level introduces a basic maze with laser obstacles. Player must find the correct path through the maze while avoiding lasers that rotate or move along fixed paths.

- Level 3 – Parkour Escape:
Player must jump between platforms while avoiding lasers. Some platforms will collapse after a short time, adding an extra challenge to the parkour elements.

- Level 4 – Ultimate Escape:
The final level includes a mix of jumping, dodging lasers, and activating switches that open doors to the exit. Player must time their movements carefully to avoid traps and escape in time.


**Game Mechanics**

- **Single-Player Experience:**
  
The game is designed as a single-player adventure where the player takes full control of navigating each level, focusing on timing, reflexes, and strategy to overcome obstacles.

- **Touch-Based Controls:**
  
Swipe Left/Right: Moves the player character left or right.
Swipe Up: Makes the player jump.
Swipe Down: Allows the player to crouch (useful for dodging certain obstacles).
Tap: Interacts with objects like switches or buttons.

- Running and Walking:
Player can control the speed of the movement based on swiping intensity. A short swipe makes the character walk, while a longer, faster swipe makes the character run. This adds an element of timing to avoid lasers and navigate obstacles.

- Jumping:
Tapping or swiping up allows the player to jump over obstacles. Some areas will require precise timing to avoid laser beams or cross collapsing platforms.

- **Laser Avoidance:**
Lasers are the primary obstacle throughout the game. They vary between static, rotating, and moving patterns, requiring precise timing to avoid. Touching a laser results in an instant loss of a life, depending on the difficulty mode.

- **Mazes and Puzzles:**
In maze level, player must navigate through a complex layout while avoiding obstacles. The layout of the maze is dynamic, with lasers blocking some paths and opening others at random intervals.

- **Parkour Mechanics:**
Parkour levels require players to jump between platforms while avoiding obstacles. Timing and precision are essential, as some platforms collapse or move.

- **Switches and Puzzles:**
Some levels include switches that players must activate to open doors or disable lasers.

- **Power-ups:**
Occasionally, power-ups spawn in difficult-to-reach areas. These can temporarily slow down obstacles, increase the player’s speed, or extend the level’s time limit, offering brief relief during particularly challenging sections.

- **Health and Timer:**
Certain levels have a time limit, requiring player to complete the level before time runs out. In advanced levels, player can take minor damage (losing a life) from non-lethal obstacles (like falling platforms), but touching lasers results in an immediate reset of the level.


**Visual and Audio Design**

- Futuristic Aesthetic:
The game features colored lasers and metallic walls, giving it a clean, sci-fi look. The lasers have a glowing effect to ensure they stand out.

- Minimalistic Design:
The overall visual design is kept simple to ensure that the focus remains on the navigation challenge.

**Background/Motivation**

Lightdash:Break the Beam draws inspiration from classic arcade-style reflex games and modern puzzle-platformers. The idea of navigating through deadly environments came from my love for high-tension parkour games where players must balance both quick decision-making and strategic planning. The combination of different challenges across levels: such as avoiding lasers, solving mazes, and completing parkour obstacles creates an engaging variety that keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting.
The decision to include mobile-friendly touch controls was based on the desire to create a highly accessible experience that players could enjoy on the go. With each level offering a unique type of challenge, from reflex-based dodging to puzzle-solving and platforming, Lightdash:Break the Beam aims to provide a broad range of challenges for mobile gamers.

I will record this information on a week-to-week basis, offering detailed insights into the tasks I undertake. Moreover, I will highlight how these tasks contribute to expanding my expertise in my role as a Mobile Game Developer. 


**September 2024**

**Week 1: Introduction of the module – W/C 23rd September 2024**

The first week started with the introduction of the Mobile Game module along with the overview of the Assessment Guide which we must submit for this module. Dr. Kurtis explained us what is required for this module and showed us past samples of students’ games for us to get an idea on our personal startup projects. He suggested us that we should be writing weekly logbooks, creating drafts/drawings of our game ideas and making a presentation. Then he guided us onto our Lab workshop which was to setup Unity for Android and IOS versions and connect it to our Mobile phones. Following on from his guidance, I decided to make separate folders for my modules of Semester 1 and started writing my logbook, organising my documents and Uploading my Lab work in GitHub to stay up to date with the progress. 

•	Reflection: I realized how important early organization is, which led me to begin structuring my work right away. Setting up the development environment was also crucial because it helped me prepare for the upcoming tasks.

•	Milestone: Created separate folders for all modules, began writing the weekly logbook, and organized my documentation. Uploaded my first lab work to GitHub to stay on track with progress.


**Week 2: Learning Prototyping & deciding Game Idea – W/C 30th September 2024**

This week, we learned about Prototyping and how Gyroscope is used in Mobile Game. Our task was to make a quick easy game utilising the sensors of a mobile phone for testing. Unfortunately, my Unity version on the PC was unable to let me test properly in my mobile as it required Android API level which kept on failing to connect to my mobile’s unity remote. I discussed this with Dr. Kurtis, and he assured me that he will look at the problem as some machines had this same issue last year as well. However, I completed the Lab work and decided to create a GitHub repository to upload my work. At first, it was a challenge to decide what I am planning to do for my Game Project for this module. I started looking up for few ideas to collect and initiated with randomly drafted my game scene. I started to decide the theme, levels, characters of the game. 

•	Reflection: I faced technical issues that slowed my progress, but it taught me the importance of troubleshooting early and managing issues with the development environment.

•	Milestone: Created my GitHub repository, completed the lab tasks, and began drafting ideas for my game project, outlining potential themes, characters, and levels.
