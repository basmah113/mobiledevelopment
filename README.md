**MobileDevelopment**

**Overview**

**Description of the Game**

**Game Mechanics**

**Background/Motivation**

**Technologies**
Softwares used to implement the Game Scene:
Visual Studio: https://https//code.visualstudio.com/
Unity: https://unity.com/


**Tutor Feedback Reflection Week 3:**

**Feedback:** Add more detailed descriptions in README and organize project folders better. Also start implementing AI Agents in the Game, detailing their actions/roles and determine how to manage the frequency of damaging the Main Boss of my game.
**Action Taken:** Updated README with clearer descriptions, folder structure, and added weekly logbook for reflection. Started planning AI Agents for my game. I roughly designed the Dracula Boss as the main character and implemented bat agents to act as enemies. These bat agents will be spawned at intervals, with their actions revolving around attacking the main character. I also began planning their behaviors using finite state machines (FSM), focusing on their damage-dealing frequency and how they will coordinate with the Main Boss (Dracula) to create a challenging gameplay experience. Incorporated health and distance checks to manage how often the AI Agents damage the Main Boss, ensuring the game balance and player engagement.
